    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Three attempts to render a move list.</p>
    <p></p>You can try them in browse mode to access all the information and in focus mode where you can tab to announce each moves. Focus mode is important because we will want to add some features.</p>
    <p>In this test, each row is a half-turn.</p>
